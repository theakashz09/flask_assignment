        "Ans = App routing in Flask refers to the mechanism of mapping URLs(or routes) to specific functions within the application. This is done using the @app.rou() decorator, which associates a URL path with a Python function(view function). When a user accesses a particular URL, the corresponding function is triggered to generate the response, which is typically HTML, JSON, or plain text.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use app routes to control how users navigate through the web application and what content is displayed at each URL. App routing allows for clean URL structures and organizes the code by associating different functions with specific routes, making the application modular and easy to manage. It also facilitates RESTful API design, enabling developers to handle different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for various operations on resources. Thus, app routes provide flexibility, efficiency, and clarity in developing web services."

For example, url_for('login', next='/') would generate a URL like /login?"
